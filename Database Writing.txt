What is a database?

A database is a collection of data which is organized in some way,
usually maximizing efficiency. They work with any type of data, from numbers
to advanced data formats, like video files. The data can often be subdivided 
into fields. Databases have many uses, from storing an inventory to 
organizing customer information. There are many types of databases, each with
a unique purpose.

Types of databases include:
Relational, Operational, Distributed, Cloud, and Centralized

What does relational mean in databases?
A relational database is an organized set of tables which contain data. 
These tables are structured in a way so that data can be accessed or organized
more efficiently than in "flat tables." Records can refer to entities, which
are listed in other tables. For example, in a normal table, you would have to
list the peoples' names and IDs. In a relational table, you could just put in
their ID and it would link to a table that includes names, ages, jobs, and more
information about the person. If you altered the essence of the "age" field,
relational databases allow you to change just the age entity table and it will
be up to date. A normal table would require that you edit every person's
details.
